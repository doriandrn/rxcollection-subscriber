## Development

### Requirements

Before you can start developing, do the following:

1. Make sure you have installed Node(7+) & Yarn(1+)
2. Fork & clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/rxcollection-subscriber.git`
3. Install the dependencies: `cd rxcollection-subscriber && yarn install`
4. Make sure that the tests work for you: `jest`

### Flow

We recommend using VSCode for the integrated tools available. If that's not an option to you, run `jest watch` in a terminal window and leave it open while adding new tests.

### Submitting a change

Whenever you feel ready for a pull-request, please ensure the following:

1. Every feature or bugfix must be committed together with a unit-test which ensures everything works as expected.
2. Do not commit build-files (anything in the `dist`-folder)
3. Before you add non-trivial changes, create an issue to discuss if this will be merged and you don't waste your time.
4. To run the unit and integration-tests, do `jest` and ensure everything works as expected.
